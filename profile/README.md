Hey hello welcome ðŸ‘‹ to Charter

## What is Charter?

Charter is a VTT (Virtual Table Top) focused on extensibility, sessions will also be decentralized as in peer-to-peer. We also want to focus on being available almost anywhere.

## Why peer-to-peer?

Because we do not want to host expensive servers and VTTs require multiplayer, documents & images to be stored. Using Peer-to-peer allows us to store that stuff on your local machine ðŸ¤“

### But how will players find each other?

Well we didn't say we won't host any servers we will need at the minimum one server to connect peers, we may look at opening this up to allow the community to host additional servers to almost build a network. For those curious we will be using [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/).

## How can I keep up to date?

Once the documentation site is made, you will be able to follow the blog.

We may create a discord for keeping up with development.

## Roadmap

Phases do not necessarily indicate releases but they are milestones.

### Phase 1

> [!WARNING]
> This phase is ground work and architectural, so very basic and will probably not be easy to use.

- Peer-to-peer collaboration
- Customization engine
- Client extensions engine
- Workspace/campaign extensions engine
- Workspace/campaign space

### Phase 2

- Design system
- Start polishing application

...more to come

## What is the difference between the customization and extensions?

The **customization** on a very basic level is theming, we want users to be able to provide a css file or data file containing their theme and have the application load the theme.

The **extensions** are more complicated:

- Client extensions directly effect the application and are not shared/synced when connecting to a session. Think adding new features like a calendar.
- Workspace/session extensions are extensions like say a D&D 5e or Pathfinder extension which adds rules to the application, or one that adds Level of detail maps (think google maps zooming in)

## 4 Core pillars

Obviously there are other pillars but these are the important ones, and yes we know they are at the bottom.

### 1. Decentralized

*Not crypto* we are just using technology crypto is built on.

- Peer-to-peer
- Offline support

### 2. Customization

Make it yours.

- Fully custom themes

### 3. Extensibility

See now you can break stuff, but anything should be possible.

- Permissions for extensions
- Application extensions
- Workspace/Session extensions

### 4. Accessibility

Okay this is gonna be difficult and probably take the longest, but **no spoilers for you**.

## Contributing

Well currently we won't be allowing contributions until Phase 1 is complete, but speaking of.

### Type of contributions

Don't worry everyone will be able to contribute! yes even you Sally!

#### Development

Uhm well if you can code in typescript, css, html and/or rust you are welcome to submit a PR **(when we open up repos)**.

#### Design

Okay this one is gonna be confusing but we will look at allowing UI/UX peers to submit designs when we get to Phase 2.

#### Non of the above

Don't be sad your input is valuable! Along with the design contributions we will look at ways for you to submit your ideas, we will have strict criteria of what goes into the main application, most features will probably be extensions! And we will make sure our submission system allows for any developer to pick it up!

## Conclusion

Wow we made it to the end of this.

### Monetization

Yes this is a problem, but for me (@sfx1909) this is a passion project and there is probably monetization potential here but thats not my vision for Charter, I have a full time job, but I have been working on the idea of Charter for a few years and finally figured out what I want it to be and how I'm going to do it.

### Fair well for now

Thanks for visiting we hope to help you charter your journey in the future!
